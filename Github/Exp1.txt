Procedure or Working
1.The station encodes its data bit as follows.
 If bit = 1 then +1 If bit = 0 then -1
 no signal (interpreted as 0) if station is idle
2. Each station is allocated a different orthogonal sequence (code) which is N bit long for N stations
3. Each station does a scalar multiplication of its encoded data bit and code sequence.
4. The resulting sequence is then stored on the channel.
5. Since the channel is common, amplitudes add up and hence resultant channel sequence is the sum of
sequences from all channels.
6. If station 1 wants to listen to station 2, it multiplies (inner product) the channel sequence with code of
station S2.
7. The inner product is then divided by N to get data bit transmitted from station 2.
How does CDMA work?
To see how CDMA works, we must understand orthogonal sequences (also known as chips).
Let N be the number of stations establishing multiple access over a common channel.
Then the properties of orthogonal sequences can be stated as follows:
An orthogonal sequence can be thought of as a 1xN matrix.
Eg: [+1 -1 +1 -1] for N = 4.
Scalar multiplication and matrix addition rules follow as usual.
Eg: 3.[+1 -1 +1 -1] = [+3 -3 +3 -3]
Eg: [+1 -1 +1 -1] + [-1 -1 -1 -1] = [0 -2 0 -2]

Inner Product: It is evaluated by multiplying two sequences element by element and then adding all
elements of the resulting list.
Inner Product of a sequence with itself is equal to N
[+1 -1 +1 -1].[+1 -1 +1 -1] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
Inner Product of two distinct sequences is zero
[+1 -1 +1 -1].[+1 +1 +1 +1] = 1-1+1-1 = 0
